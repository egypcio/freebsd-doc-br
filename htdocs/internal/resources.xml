  <h2>Rationale</h2>

  <p>The core team manages access to project resources including
    granting and revoking both commit bits and user accounts.  Core
    may delegate portions of these tasks to other groups or
    individuals at its discretion.  For example, certain commit bits
    are managed by other groups as noted
    in <a href="../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/committers-guide/committer.types.html">Commit
    Bit Types</a> subject to core's final approval.  The core team has
    held this authority since its inception, but wanted to make it
    explicit to avoid confusion.  The FreeBSD Core team approved the
    following commit bit and project resources policy which was posted
    to the Developers mailing list on August 4, 2011.</p>

  <h2>Policy</h2>

  <p>The core team has sole authority for managing access to project
    resources.  This includes granting and revoking both commit bits
    and user accounts.</p>
