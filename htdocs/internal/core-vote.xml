    <h3>Committers</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>All core members vote "yes", "no" or "no objection".</li>
      <li>Successful candidates must get at least one yes vote.</li>
      <li>Successful candidates must not get any 'no' votes.</li>
      <li>At least three people must vote.</li>
      <li>Voting period is normally 1 week, or ending sooner when the
	result is certain.</li>
      <li>Core secretary to deal with the details of voting, notification,
	etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Personnel</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>All core members vote "yes" or "no".</li>
      <li>Successful candidates must get at least (2/3 * core-size)
	yes vote.</li>
      <li>At least (2/3 * core-size) people must vote, or the measure
	will fail.</li>
      <li>Voting period is normally 1 week, or ending sooner when the
	result is certain.</li>
      <li>Core secretary to deal with the details of voting, notification,
	etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Issues</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Discussion takes place.</li>
      <li>When a consensus resolution appears to have been reached,
	a vote on that takes place.</li>
      <li>All core members vote "yes" or "no".</li>
      <li>Successful resolutions must get at least (2/3 * core-size)
	yes vote.</li>
      <li>At least (2/3 * core-size) people must vote, or the measure
	will fail.</li>
      <li>Voting period is normally 1 week, or ending sooner when the
	result is certain.</li>
      <li>Core secretary to deal with the details of voting, notification,
	etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Without Objection</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Any core member may ask core, via email, if they can take
        some mundane action, subject to a quick sanity check of the
        rest of core.</li>
      <li>If no one objects within 48 hours, then that person may proceed
	(or sooner if (2/3 * core-size) members agree).</li>
      <li>If there are any objections, then it will be resolved via the
	issue voting procedure.</li>
      <li>Core secretary may send the OK to proceed message, as the
        secretary deems appropriate.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Any committer may also use this mechanism so long as at least one
      core member says 'yes' and the previous paragraph is otherwise
      followed.  It is intended to be used for mundane matters that
      need a quick sanity check, but don't need a more heavy weight
      and deliberative process.  It is believed that the subset of
      core present for any given 48 period are sufficient for both
      sanity checking mundane matters and recognizing non-mundane
      matters that need to be handled via the issues voting
      procedure.</p>
