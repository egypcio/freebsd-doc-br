    <p>FreeBSD's documentation falls into three basic categories:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi"><b>The manual pages</b></a></p>

	<p>The Project does not really concern itself with these, since
	  they are a part of the base system. The exception to this is the
	  Japanese team, who are translating them. There is no reason other
	  volunteers could not step in to translate the manual pages to other
	  languages as well.</p>

	<p>That is not to say that the manual pages are unimportant, far from
	  it. It is just that they are intimately tied to specific systems of
	  FreeBSD, and most of the time the best person to write the manual
	  page is the person that wrote that part of FreeBSD.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="../docs/books.html"><b>The Books</b></a></p>

	<p>The project has a large amount of documentation that is "book
	  length", or becoming that way.  These include the FreeBSD FAQ and
	  the FreeBSD Handbook.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="../docs/books.html#ARTICLES"><b>The Articles</b></a></p>

	<p>FreeBSD has a wealth of information available in shorter, article
	  form -- similar to the tutorials or HOWTO documentation of other
	  projects.</p></li>
    </ol>
