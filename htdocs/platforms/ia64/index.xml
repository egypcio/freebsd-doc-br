		<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

		<p>The FreeBSD/ia64 project pages contain information about the
		  FreeBSD port to Intel's IA-64 architecture; officially known as
		  the Intel Itanium&reg; Processor Family (IPF).  As with the port
		  itself, these pages are still mostly a work in progress.</p>

		<h3><a name="status">Current status</a></h3>

		<p>The ia64 port is still considered a tier 2 platform. This boils
		  down to not being fully supported by our security officer, release
		  engineers and toolchain maintainers. In practice however the
		  distinction between a tier 1 platform (which is fully supported)
		  and a tier 2 platform is not as strict as it seems. In almost all
		  aspects the ia64 port is a tier 1 platform.
		  <br/>
		  From a developer point of view there's an advantage to have the ia64
		  port be a tier 2 platform for a while longer. We still have a couple
		  of ABI breaking changes in the pipeline and having to maintain
		  backward compatibility this early in a ports life is less than
		  ideal.</p>
