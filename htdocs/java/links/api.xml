    <h2> API - Extensions by Sun Microsystems </h2>

      The following list contains an excerpt from the available
      API definitions and implementations from SUN (for a start see
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/products">Java Products</a> and go e.g. to Standard Extensions)

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc">JFC (Java Foundation Classes)</a><br/>
	That is where Swing comes from. For more info see
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc">The Swing Connection</a>.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/index.html">Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Media Framework</a><br/>
	The Java Media Framework (JMF) 1.0 API specifies a simple,
	unified architecture, messaging protocol, and programming interface
	for media playback. This API was developed by Sun Microsystems,
	Inc., Silicon Graphics Inc., and Intel Corporation.
	<br/>
	The Java Media Framework (JMF) 2.0 API extends the 1.0 API by
	providing capture functionality, pluggable codecs, file saving, RTP
	broadcast and the ability to access and manipulate media data before it
	is rendered. This API is available for public review, and was developed
	by Sun Microsystems, Inc. and IBM. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/index.html">Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Advanced Imaging</a><br/>
	The Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) API is the extensible,
	network-aware programming interface for creating advanced image processing
	applications and applets in the Java programming language. The
	Java Advanced Imaging API offers a rich set of image processing features
	such as tiling, deferred execution and multiprocessor scalability.
	Fully compatible with the Java 2D API, developers can easily extend the image
	processing capabilities and performance of standard Java 2D applications
	with the Java Advanced Imaging API.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/">Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Serial Port (COMM)</a> <br/>
	The Java Serial Port can be used to write platform-independent communications
	applications for technologies such as voice mail, fax, and smartcards.
	Its current version supports RS232 serial ports and IEEE 1284 parallel ports.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/index.html">Java 3D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup></a><br/>
	The Java 3DTM 1.1 API is a set of classes for writing
	three-dimensional graphics applications and 3D applets. It gives
	developers high level constructs for creating and manipulating 3D
	geometry and for constructing the structures used in rendering that
	geometry. Application developers can describe very large virtual
	worlds using these constructs, which provides Java 3D with enough
	information to render these worlds efficiently. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/index.html">JavaMail</a><br/>
	The JavaMail API provides a set of abstract classes that models a mail system.
	The API is meant to provide a platform independent and protocol
	independent framework to build Java-based mail and messaging applications. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javahelp/index.html">JavaHelp<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup></a><br/>
	JavaHelp is the Help system for the Java platform: it is a Java-based,
	platform independent help system that enables Java developers to
	incorporate online help for a variety of needs, including Java components,
	applications (network and stand-alone), desktops, and HTML pages.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/beans/glasgow/jaf.html">JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Activation Framework (JAF)</a><br/>
	With the JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) developers can take
	advantage of standard services to determine the type of an arbitrary
	piece of data, encapsulate access to it, discover the operations
	available on it and to instantiate the appropriate JavaBeans
	component to perform these operations.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.html">Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Servlet</a><br/>
	Java Servlet provides a uniform, industry-supported
	interface for extending a web server with cross-platform and
	cross-server components written in the Java Programming Language.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jce/index.html">Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Cryptography (JCE)</a><br/>
	The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 1.2 provides a framework and
	implementations for encryption, key generation and key agreement, and Message
	Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms. Support for encryption includes
	symmetric, asymmetric, block, and stream ciphers. The software also supports
	secure streams and sealed objects. </li>
      <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/beans/infobus/index.html">InfoBus</a><br/>
	InfoBus enables dynamic exchange of data between JavaBeans components by
	defining a small  number of interfaces between cooperating Beans and specifying
	the protocol for use of those interfaces.<br/>
	The protocols are based on a notion of an information bus. All components
	which implement these interfaces can plug into the bus. As a member of the
	bus any component can exchange data with any other component in structured
	way, including arrays, tables, and database rowsets.</li>
      <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/index.html">Java Naming and Directory Interface<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> (JNDI)</a><br/>
	Provides uniform, industry-standard, seamless connectivity from the
	Java platform to business information assets, thus allowing developers to
	deliver Java applications with unified access to multiple naming and directory
	services across the enterprise.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml">The XML Project</a><br/>
	Sun&acute;s home for combining XML and Java Technology</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Third Party packages... </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.objectspace.com/products/jglOverview.htm">JGL (Java Generic Library)</a><br/>
	A collection API implementation including linked lists etc. The Collection
	API before invention of CollectionAPI in JDK1.2.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4j">XML4J</a><br/>
	XML Parser for java from IBM.</li>
