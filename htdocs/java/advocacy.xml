<p>We would like to have FreeBSD known as the stable &java; platform.</p>

<p><b>Request for Enhancement to Sun</b>:
<br/>We have petitioned Sun to provide an official FreeBSD port. We are currently
 in <b>2nd</b> place in the vote count.  If you are a member of the Java Developer's Connection
(it's free), you can vote for it as well

<p><b>Petition IBM for a port to FreeBSD</b>:
<br/>In October, 1999, IBM released a new version of their IBM Developer Kit for Linux.  We would like to see them release one for FreeBSD.  If anyone has a point of contact in IBM that could spearhead this petition, please let <a href="mailto:patrick@FreeBSD.org">Patrick Gardella</a> know.</p>
